# **Investigating Projectile Motion: Dependence of Range on Launch Angle**

Projectile motion, the movement of an object thrown at an angle to the horizontal, is a fundamental concept in physics. Understanding how the range of a projectile depends on the launch angle is not only mathematically intriguing but also has numerous real-world applications. This principle is widely used in various fields, from analyzing the flight of a soccer ball to calculating the trajectory of a spacecraft.

## **1. Theoretical Foundation**

I see you're asking about deriving the equations for projectile motion, specifically the range equation $R = \frac{v\_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$, as shown in the image. Let's go through the derivation step by step using the given equations of motion. We'll assume you're looking to derive the range \$R\$, since that's the final equation highlighted, but if you'd like to derive another part (like the time of flight), let me know!

### Step 1: Understand the Setup

Projectile motion describes an object launched at an initial velocity $v\_0$ at an angle $\theta$ to the horizontal, under the influence of gravity $g$ (with no air resistance). The motion can be broken into two independent components:

* **Horizontal motion** (x-direction): Constant velocity, since there's no horizontal acceleration.
* **Vertical motion** (y-direction): Accelerated motion due to gravity.

The given equations are:

* Horizontal position: $x = v\_0 \cos \theta \cdot t$
* Vertical position: $y = v\_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$
* Time of flight: $t=\frac{2 v\_0 \sin \theta}{g}$ (when $y = 0$, i.e., when the projectile returns to the ground)
* Range: $R = \frac{v\_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$

Our goal is to derive the range \$R\$.

---

### Step 2: Derive the Time of Flight

First, we need the total time the projectile is in the air (time of flight). The projectile returns to the ground when its vertical position \$y = 0\$.

Use the vertical position equation:

$$
y = v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

Set \$y = 0\$ (when the projectile lands):

$$
0 = v_0 \sin \theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$

Factor out \$t\$:

$$
t \left( v_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t \right) = 0
$$

This gives two solutions:

* \$t = 0\$ (the launch point)
* \$v\_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t = 0\$

Solve the second equation:

$$
v_0 \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} g t = 0
$$

$$
\frac{1}{2} g t = v_0 \sin \theta
$$

$$
t = \frac{v_0 \sin \theta}{\frac{1}{2} g} = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$

This matches the given time of flight:

$$
t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g}
$$

This is the total time the projectile is in the air.

---

### Step 3: Derive the Range \$R\$

The range \$R\$ is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile lands, i.e., the value of \$x\$ when \$t = \frac{2 v\_0 \sin \theta}{g}\$.

Use the horizontal position equation:

$$
x = v_0 \cos \theta \cdot t
$$

Substitute the time of flight \$t = \frac{2 v\_0 \sin \theta}{g}\$:

$$
R = x = v_0 \cos \theta \cdot \left( \frac{2 v_0 \sin \theta}{g} \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
R = \frac{v_0 \cdot 2 v_0 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{g} = \frac{2 v_0^2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{g}
$$

Now, use the trigonometric identity \$\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\$:

$$
2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin(2\theta)
$$

Substitute this into the equation:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

This matches the given range equation:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

---

### Step 4: Verify the Result

The derived equation shows that the range depends on:

* The square of the initial velocity (\$v\_0^2\$),
* The sine of twice the launch angle (\$\sin(2\theta)\$),
* The gravitational acceleration (\$g\$).

This makes physical sense:

* A higher initial velocity increases the range (since \$v\_0^2\$).
* The \$\sin(2\theta)\$ term indicates that the range is maximized when \$2\theta = 90^\circ\$, or \$\theta = 45^\circ\$, which is a well-known result in projectile motion.
* A larger \$g\$ (e.g., on a planet with stronger gravity) reduces the range.

---

### Final Answer

The range of the projectile is:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

This was derived by:

1. Finding the time of flight by setting the vertical position to zero.
2. Substituting the time of flight into the horizontal position equation.
3. Simplifying using the trigonometric identity \$2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin(2\theta)\$.

If you'd like to derive any other part of the projectile motion equations (e.g., maximum height) or need a numerical example, let me know!

## **2. Range Analysis Based on Launch Angle**

Key observations:

* **Maximum range** occurs at \$\theta = 45^\circ\$ (assuming no air resistance).
* **Symmetry of trajectory:** The same range is achieved at complementary angles (e.g., \$30^\circ\$ and \$60^\circ\$ result in the same range).
* **Dependence on velocity:** Since \$R\propto v\_0^2\$, doubling the initial velocity quadruples the range.
* **Effect of gravity:** On planets with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon, where \$g \approx 1.62\$ m/s¬≤), projectiles travel much farther than on Earth.

## **3. Practical Applications of Projectile Motion**

Projectile motion plays a crucial role in various fields:

1. **Sports:** Optimizing kick angles in soccer, basketball shots, and long jumps.
2. **Ballistics:** Calculating bullet and missile trajectories.
3. **Engineering:** Designing structures resistant to impact forces.
4. **Space Exploration:** Determining launch trajectories for satellites and landers.

However, real-world factors complicate the idealized model:

* **Air resistance** reduces the range.
* **Uneven terrain** affects the landing position.
* **Magnus effect (object spin)** alters the trajectory (e.g., in soccer or tennis).

## **4. Implementation and Visualization with Code**

To gain a deeper understanding of projectile motion, Python can be used to compute and visualize the relationship between launch angle and range.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def range_of_projectile(v0, theta, g=9.81):
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g

# Variable
v0 = 20  # –º/—Å
angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) 
ranges = [range_of_projectile(v0, theta) for theta in angles]

# Graph
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'v0 = {v0} –º/—Å')
plt.xlabel('Launch Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (m)')
plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
